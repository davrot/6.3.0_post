/**
 * FIXTURE CREDENTIALS — the controlled identities every e2e spec runs as.
 *
 * Owner decision 2026-09-05: "tests run against a controlled test instance
 * (like forgejo)" — so identities are FIXED and documented here, created by
 * global-setup (deterministic seed), and NEVER by a spec at random.
 *
 * Policy:
 *  - these accounts exist ONLY in the disposable test stack (ol-e2e volumes);
 *  - stack-reset.sh wipes them (fresh volume + re-seed);
 *  - passwords are test-only dummies (no real credential anywhere in this
 *    tree — owner rule).
